To have good grapes && to produce good wine, it is necessary to dedicate many hours of work (even if you are tired or the weather is not favorable). Since I learned how to code, I treat each snippet of code the same way as I treat the vineyards. So if your grapes are rip && you need a Software Developer for your harvest season, you found him.",
